#### Database Initialization and pgvector Extension

I've refined the initialization process for the pgvector vector database as follows:

```python
async def init_db() -> None:
    create_database(
        settings.DB_NAME,
        settings.DB_USER,
        settings.DB_PASS,
        settings.DB_HOST,
        settings.DB_PORT,
    )
    # Ensure the vector extension is created after initializing the database
    await create_extension()
    logger.info("Vector extension creation check attempted.")

    async_engine = create_async_engine(settings.ASYNC_DATABASE_URI, echo=True)

    async with async_engine.begin() as conn:
        await conn.run_sync(Base.metadata.create_all)

    logger.info("Database initialized and all tables created if they didn't exist.")
```

By leveraging the following:

```python
@asynccontextmanager
async def app_lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    await init_db()
    yield

app = FastAPI(lifespan=app_lifespan)
```

This approach internalizes the process within the code, eliminating the need for workarounds and optimizing the setup. I've also modified the Dockerfile as follows to avoid issues with model loading each time the application is launched:

```dockerfile
# Install necessary dependencies
RUN pip install sentence-transformers

# Pre-download the model to the image
RUN python -c "from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer; SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')"
```

This setup will be replaced with a solution where the model is either loaded from a volume or the results are directly returned via an API (we'll test OpenAI's embedding models).

Additionally, I plan to explore another extension integrated with PostgreSQL, `pg_embedding`, as seen below:

As hinted at in the previous episode, the next step involves setting up Cloud Run connected to Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL.

Stay tuned.
